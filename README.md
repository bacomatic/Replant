Replant
=======

Simple plant replanting mod for Minecraft

Works with 1.7.2, Forge 10.12.1.1060.

All this mod does is listen for when plantable items are about to expire in the
world. When they do, rather than being destroyed they are planted in the ground.
This takes some of the headache out of replanting trees when harvesting wood.
Instead of breaking the leaves trying to get saplings, just let them fall to the
ground, five minutes later they will automatically be planted.

All vanilla plants are supported, including double height plants like rose bushes.

Requires:
- Minecraft 7.2
- Forge 10.12.1.1060 or later
- Java 7 or later (Java 6 is dead people!)

Known Issues:
- None yet
